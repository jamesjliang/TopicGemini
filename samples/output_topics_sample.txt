**Note: By running Retrieval Augmented Generation for LLMs, users can get a deeper insight into the topic being discussed. This is done by writing a prompt about a specific topic, allowing the LLM to retrieve relevant NYT documents and collate a summary.

## Example: 
Topic cluster 6: sports
    - champions league finals

Let's say a user was interested in champions league finals in sports. A prompt could be engineered in the following way:
	prompt = "Summarise the news extracts about the sports topic, champions league finals"

## Output:
    - champions league finals
